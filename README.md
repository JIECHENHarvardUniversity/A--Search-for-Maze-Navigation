# Astar-Search-for-Maze-Navigation

This project is developed to realize the A* algorithm in the maze navigation problem
In Astar.h, an object containing the A* algorithm is defined
In Astar.cpp, the A* algorithm has been developed
In AstarMain.cpp, a matrix is defined to simulate the maze environment, and the A* algorithm is used to search for a shortest path from the start point to the end point in the matrix
